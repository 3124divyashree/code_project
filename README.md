AUTOMATIC VEHICLE DETECTION USING PYTHON

This project implements a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using Python and OpenCV. It uses background subtraction (MOG2) and contour detection to identify moving vehicles from traffic video footage. The system tracks vehicles across frames and updates a live vehicle count using a virtual line crossing method. Ideal for applications in traffic monitoring, surveillance, and smart transportation.
